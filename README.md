# cat-bot-calculator
Reverse engineering the code of cat bot (https://github.com/milenakos/cat-bot) to calculate odds of different things

## Packs
So far this only calculates the chances of winning things from a pack, which I believe are way too low considering how few you can get from the battlepass.

For instance, each gold pack has a 0.13% chance of giving you an eGirl, making it only 2.5 times better than a random cat spawn, but you only get 5 each month in the battlepass... your odds are better at the casino.
